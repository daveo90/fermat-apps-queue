# Welcome to the Fermat APPs Queue

## Introduction

Fermat is to easily build Android APPs running on top of the Fermat Framework, which we call Fermat APPs. Anybody can code this APPs, but in the early stage where the Fermat project is, the same network of developers is willing to write de code of a first set of Fermat APPs in order to test the overall architecture of the system.

For that reason we manage a queue of third parties APPs to be coded by ourselves as a way to bootstrap the system. So, who can add candidate APPs to the queue? Any industry member that has a running service can add a candidate APP to the queue. A team managing this will evaluate the candidate APP and assing a weight according to how well it fits into Fermat's strategy at this stage. This weight repositions the candidate on the queue or waiting list.
